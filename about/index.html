<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hm? What, you want to hear more? Oh, that's all we need. Another inquisitive soul...</h1>
	<p>I'm a recent MA graduate from the University of Waterloo who studied Philosophy. As a philosopher I focused on logic, mathematics and language, asking questions like, 'How do mathematical models apply to the world in Scientific theories?' and 'What is the relationship between formal and "natural" language?' But, like so many others who choose to study the esoteric disciplines, I began in another field; namely, Computer Science. Currently I live in Edmonton, working for a SaaS startup. Here you'll find a smattering of my projects and interests&mdash;please feel free to contact me regarding anything you find interesting here!</p>
