<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Stay awhile and listen...</h1>
	<p>I'm a recent MA graduate from the University of Waterloo who studied Philosophy. As a philosopher I focused on logic, mathematics and language, asking questions like, 'How do mathematical models apply to the world in Scientific theories?' and 'What is the relationship between formal and "natural" language?' But, like so many others who choose to study the esoteric disciplines, I began in another field; namely, Computer Science. There I acquired the fundamental skills to navigating modern technology and software (and from which this very site is built!). Life's too short too write a long 'about me' though&mdash;so feel free to contact me or otherwise explore this site!</p>
