  <h1>Learning Chess with ML</h1>
  <p>Here's a little project I put together to help my chess game. The problem: I suck at chess; but also, whenever I'm learning games I like to forge my own path and learn concepts by acting on strategies I prefer (even when theyre known to be losing). So thinking backwards, the steps to having my fun involve learning opening theory and tactics related to positions I want to play in; but without the concepts already learned for chess theory, how do I know which opening moves and which choices will more often put me in situations I *want* to play in? The solution: read chess books. That's probably the best way to do this, but that's not as much fun. My solution: make an AI that's stronger than me and that plays chess the way I'd like to; then, extrapolate out the choices it makes the most often and mold my game after the AI.</p>
  <p>For starters, lets take a look at my chess.com rating over time...</p>
